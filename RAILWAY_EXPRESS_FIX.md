# Railway Express Server Fix

## Problem
The Railway deployment was showing "Application failed to respond" even though the logs indicated the server was starting. The issue was likely with the `serve` package not working reliably in the Railway environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Replaced `serve` with Express
- Created a custom Express server (`server.js`) that's more reliable than the `serve` package
- Added proper error handling and graceful shutdown
- Included health check endpoint for Railway monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Startup Script
- Updated `start-server.js` with better error handling and process management
- Added checks for build directory and files existence
- Improved logging and debugging information

### 3. Updated Dependencies and Configuration
- Added Express as a dependency
- Updated Railway configuration to use `/health` endpoint for health checks
- Configured proper port handling and environment variables

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `Ads2Go-Client/package.json` - Added Express dependency, updated start script
- `Ads2Go-Client/railway.toml` - Updated healthcheck path to `/health`
- `Ads2Go-Client/start-server.js` - Enhanced with better error handling

### New Files:
- `Ads2Go-Client/server.js` - Custom Express server for Railway

## Key Features of the Express Server

### 1. Static File Serving
```javascript
app.use(express.static(buildPath));
```

### 2. React Router Support
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(buildPath, 'index.html'));
});
```

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    status: 'ok', 
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    port: port 
  });
});
```

### 4. Graceful Shutdown
- Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- Properly closes server connections
- Exits cleanly on shutdown

## Railway Configuration

```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start:prod"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300

[env]
NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
PORT = "3000"
```

## Benefits of Express Server

1. **More Reliable**: Express is more stable than the `serve` package
2. **Better Error Handling**: Custom error handling and logging
3. **Health Checks**: Dedicated `/health` endpoint for Railway monitoring
4. **React Router Support**: Properly handles client-side routing
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles Railway's shutdown signals properly

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Railway** - the Express server should be more reliable
3. **Monitor the deployment logs** for successful startup
4. **Test the application** at your Railway URL

## Verification

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Express server starting on correct port
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding
- ✅ Application accessible and working

The Express server should resolve the "Application failed to respond" issue and provide a more stable deployment on Railway.
