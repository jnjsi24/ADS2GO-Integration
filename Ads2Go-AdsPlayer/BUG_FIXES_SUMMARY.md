# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Tablet Not Found Error
**Problem**: The `updateTabletStatus` endpoint was returning "Tablet not found" because the tablet registration was failing or the tablet wasn't properly registered in the database.

**Solution**: 
- Added automatic re-registration logic in `updateTabletStatus` method
- When "Tablet not found" error occurs, the system automatically attempts to re-register the tablet
- This ensures the tablet stays connected even if there are temporary registration issues

**Files Modified**: `androidPlayerExpo/services/tabletRegistration.ts`

### 2. Material Not Found Error
**Problem**: The `materialId` being used was in ObjectId format (`68b1f45b9384e0cec97f66aa`) but the server expected a string format like `"DGL-HEADDRESS-CAR-001"`.

**Solution**:
- Added `convertObjectIdToMaterialId` method to automatically convert ObjectIds to proper materialId format
- The method queries the server to get the actual materialId string from the ObjectId
- Falls back to using the ObjectId if conversion fails
- Updated `fetchAds` method to use the converted materialId

**Files Modified**: `androidPlayerExpo/services/tabletRegistration.ts`

### 3. Video Playback Error (404)
**Problem**: Video URLs were returning 404 errors, indicating invalid or non-existent Firebase storage URLs.

**Solution**:
- Added `validateVideoUrl` method to check if video URLs are accessible before attempting playback
- Added `filterValidAds` method to filter out ads with invalid video URLs
- Implemented automatic retry logic - when a video fails to load (404, network errors), it automatically skips to the next ad
- Added comprehensive video loading event handlers for better debugging
- Enhanced error messages to provide more specific information about what went wrong

**Files Modified**: `androidPlayerExpo/components/AdPlayer.tsx`

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages with specific details about what could cause issues
- Added automatic retry mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Improved offline mode handling with cached ads validation

### Video Validation
- Videos are now validated before being added to the playlist
- Invalid videos are automatically filtered out
- Better logging for video loading states

### Registration Robustness
- Automatic re-registration when tablets are not found
- Better error recovery for network issues
- Improved logging for debugging registration problems

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Tablet Registration**: Verify that tablets can register and stay connected
2. **Test Material ID Conversion**: Ensure ObjectIds are properly converted to materialId strings
3. **Test Video Playback**: Verify that only valid videos are played and invalid ones are skipped
4. **Test Error Recovery**: Verify that the system recovers from various error conditions

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Tablets should stay connected and update their status successfully
- ✅ Ads should be fetched using the correct materialId format
- ✅ Invalid videos should be automatically skipped
- ✅ Better error messages should help with debugging
- ✅ System should be more robust and self-healing

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Additional logging has been added for better debugging
- Error handling is now more graceful and user-friendly
