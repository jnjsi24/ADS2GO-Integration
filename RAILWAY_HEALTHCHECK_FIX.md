# Railway Healthcheck Fix

## Problem
The Railway deployment was successful, but the healthcheck was failing because the application wasn't responding on the correct port. Railway expects applications to listen on the `PORT` environment variable, but the app was hardcoded to port 3000.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Port Configuration
- Updated `start:prod` script to use Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- Created a robust `start-server.js` script that properly handles port configuration
- Updated Railway configuration to set proper port defaults

### 2. Enhanced Start Script
- Created `start-server.js` that dynamically uses the `PORT` environment variable
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Ensures the serve command uses the correct port

### 3. Updated Railway Configuration
- Increased healthcheck timeout to 300 seconds
- Set proper environment variables in `railway.toml`
- Configured correct start command

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `Ads2Go-Client/package.json` - Updated start:prod script
- `Ads2Go-Client/railway.toml` - Fixed port configuration and timeouts

### New Files:
- `Ads2Go-Client/start-server.js` - Railway-compatible start script

## Key Changes

### Before:
```json
"start:prod": "serve -s build -l 3000"
```

### After:
```json
"start:prod": "node start-server.js"
```

### Railway Configuration:
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start:prod"
healthcheckPath = "/"
healthcheckTimeout = 300

[env]
NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
PORT = "3000"
```

## How It Works

1. **Railway sets the `PORT` environment variable** (usually a random port)
2. **Our `start-server.js` script reads this port** and uses it with the serve command
3. **The serve command starts on the correct port** that Railway expects
4. **Healthcheck can now reach the application** on the proper port

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Railway** - the healthcheck should now pass
3. **Monitor the deployment logs** to ensure successful startup

## Verification

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Deploy successful  
- ✅ Healthcheck successful
- ✅ Application accessible at your Railway URL

The healthcheck failure should be resolved, and your Railway client should deploy and run successfully!
