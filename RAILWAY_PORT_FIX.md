# Railway Port Configuration Fix

## Problem
The application is running successfully on Railway (as shown in the logs), but it's not accessible via the public URL. The issue is a port mismatch between Railway's configuration and the actual port the application is using.

## Root Cause
- **Railway Configuration**: Expects the app on port 3000
- **Express Server**: Running on port 8080 (Railway's assigned PORT)
- **Result**: Railway can't route traffic to the correct port

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Railway Configuration
- Removed hardcoded `PORT = "3000"` from `railway.toml`
- Let Railway automatically assign the PORT environment variable
- Railway will now properly route traffic to whatever port the app uses

### 2. Updated Express Server
- Changed default port from 3000 to 8080 to match Railway's assignment
- Added debugging logs to show the actual PORT being used
- Ensured the server properly uses `process.env.PORT`

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added environment variable logging
- Added process PID logging
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting

## Files Modified

### Modified Files:
- `Ads2Go-Client/railway.toml` - Removed hardcoded PORT
- `Ads2Go-Client/server.js` - Updated default port and added debugging

## Key Changes

### Before:
```toml
[env]
NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
PORT = "3000"  # ❌ This was causing the mismatch
```

### After:
```toml
[env]
NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
# ✅ Let Railway assign the PORT automatically
```

### Express Server:
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;  // ✅ Use Railway's assigned port
```

## How Railway Port Assignment Works

1. **Railway assigns a random port** (usually 8080, 8081, etc.)
2. **Sets PORT environment variable** to that port
3. **Your app should use `process.env.PORT`** to listen on that port
4. **Railway routes traffic** from the public domain to that port

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Railway** - the port configuration should now be correct
3. **Check the deployment logs** - you should see the correct port being used
4. **Test the application** - it should now be accessible via the public URL

## Verification

After deployment, you should see in the logs:
- ✅ Express server starting on Railway's assigned port (e.g., 8080)
- ✅ Environment PORT showing the correct value
- ✅ Application accessible at `https://ads2go-client-production.up.railway.app/`

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:
1. Check Railway's networking settings
2. Verify the target port in Railway dashboard matches the actual port
3. Check if there are any firewall or routing issues
4. Review the deployment logs for any errors

The port configuration fix should resolve the accessibility issue and make your application available via the public Railway URL.
